				Donald Trump related Tweets 

1. Collect: The data is the tweets and the users those who tweeted about Donald Trumps recent victory in the presidential election.The data chosen is from four GPS locations 
	a) Maryland
	b) California
	c) Oklahama
	d)West Virginia
The reason for chossing the States of California and Maryland are that the majority votes in these regions have gone to Hilary Clinton and people have been protesting after Donald Trumps election as president.On the other habd the states of Oklahama and West Virginia are Trump strong hold regions, Trump has won with large amounts of votes in these regions.The output of collect is stored in csv files with the respective state name.

2. Cluster: The data collected for clustering is 5 users from each state along with their 200 friends , so typically a range of aroung 20*200 users were collected.The graph was constructed and betweeness was used as the parameter in determining the comunities. I tried to incorporate a max and min user comunity mechanism but due to a large graph of over 3000 nodes the calculation time for betweeness was quite high and hence I had to go with the traditional approach.A graph represnting the nodes as users and follower relationship as edges is plotted in a file called "cluster.png".
The Clustering helped us identify the users who actually talk about politics and follow politics in terms of the people involved and some users who are occasional  tweeters regarding politics.

3. Classify: The tweets collected where vectorized and tested. Logistic Regression was used to fit the model for sentiment analysis on the tweets.Training data was collected from 1.6M Affin pre classified tweets. A script called get.py was written in order to extract 500 postive and nagative tweets from the data(pos.csv and neg.csv). I also tried out Naive Bayes model to fit the data.
The results for classification as expected:
California,Maryland: More than 50% of the tweet about Trump were negative in these areas , as they are strong Hilary Clinton supporters.
West Virginia, Oklahama: Most of the tweets from these areas are positive but the number is not quite extereme.
